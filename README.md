# KLESSYDRA-S1 IN-ORDER EXECUTION PROCESSOR

Intro: The Klessydra processing core family is a set of processors featuring full compliance with RISC-V, and pin-to-pin compatible with the PULPino Riscy cores. Klessydra-S1 is a bare-metal 32-bit processor fully supporting the RV32IM from the RISC-V ISA, and one instruction from the Atomic "A" extension. 'S1' further extends the instruction set with a set of custom vector instructions.

Architecture: S1 as its S0 predecessor vesions is also a single hart processor, it supports superscalar execution between the units in the execute stage, it implements basic 1-bit branch prediction, and data-dependency checking logic, as well as registerfile bypass logics. It also introduces a custom vector coprocessor, to accelerate the executuon of the vector arithmetic operations.

The Coprocessor is a highly parametrizable accelerator, with up to 256-bit SIMD+MIMD execution capabilities. It comprises the Multipurpose Functional Unit, and the Scratchpad Memory Interface. The custom instruction set supported are listed in the Technincal manuals in the Docs folder. In addition to SIMD execution, the coprocessor supports subword-SIMD to further accelerate 8-bit and 16-bit integer data types.

The coprocessor features a parametrizable set of Scratchpad memories 'SPMs' (parametrizable being their size and number, and their bank numbers will automatically expand to match the SIMD configuration). 

The coprocessor can be configured to run in three different modes:

1) Shared Coprocessor: Where the coprocessor is shared by all the harts (SIMD Coprocessor).
2) Fully Symmetrical Coprocessor: Where each hart has its dedicated MFU and SPMI. (SIMD+MIMD Coprocessor ver.1).
3) Heterogeneous coprocessor: Where the harts share the functional units in the MFU, but each hart maintains it own dedicated SPMI (SIMD+MIMD coprocessor ver.2).

Parameters:
- N = Number of SPMs in the SPMI.
- M = Number of SPMIs, as well as control logic for every hart (Note supported in the Klessydra-T families).
- D = Number of Functional Units per MFU, and banks per SPM (i.e. determines the SIMD width).
- F = Number of Functional Units per hart (i.e. determines the MIMD width, supported only in Klessydra-T families).

# Merging S1 User Guide

This guide explains how one can download and install Pulpino, and it's 
modified version of the riscv-gnu toolchain. It also demonstrates
how to patch the offcial riscv-toolchain in order to add the klessydra custom
vector extensions. And then it shows how you can easily merge the Klessydra-Core 
with the Pulpino project.

###########################################################################################
- Prerequisites as indicated by the pulpino group
	- ModelSim in reasonably recent version (we tested it with versions 10.2c)
	- CMake >= 2.8.0, versions greater than 3.1.0 recommended due to support for ninja
	- riscv-toolchain, there are two choices for getting the toolchain: 

  		1) RECOMENDED OPTION: Use the custom version of the RISC-V toolchain from ETH. 
  		The ETH versions supports all the ISA extensions that were incorporated 
	  	into the RI5CY core as well as the reduced base instruction set for zero-riscy.
	        " https://github.com/pulp-platform/ri5cy_gnu_toolchain.git "

		2) Or download the official RISC-V toolchain supported by Berkeley.
 	       	" https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain "


	  	Please make sure you are using the newlib version of the toolchain.
	- python2 >= 2.6
	
###########################################################################################

- IF you already have pulpino and their own version of the riscv-toolchain, then skip ahead to step.4


PROCEDURE:
1.	Install the following packeges:
		
		sudo apt-get install git cmake python-yaml tcsh autoconf automake autotools-dev curl libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev

2.	Download and build the "ri5cy_gnu_toolchain"

		a) git clone https://github.com/pulp-platform/ri5cy_gnu_toolchain.git
		
		b) cd ri5cy_gnu_toolchain
		
		c) make ZERORISCY=1

		d) in case you need to build for RISCY cores, then just do "make" instead, and then add the symbolic links as shown from step 4.
		
	When the build is done, add the path **_<path_to_toolchain>/ri5cy_gnu_toolchain/install/bin_** to the environmental variables

3.	Download the PULPino suite:

		a) git clone https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulpino.git
		
		b) cd pulpino
		
		c) ./update-ips.py	


4.	If you want to run the klessydra specific tests, you have to download and patch the official riscv-toolchain, and then build it. Instructions for doing so are included in the README.md file
	inside the folder called "toolchain_files".

5.	To merge the Klessydra core, and tests:

		a) git clone https://github.com/klessydra/S1.git
		
		b) cd S1
		
		c) ./runMErge.sh <pulpino_path>

6.	OPTIONAL: After merging is done, this is how you will be able to test Klessydra-s1.
		-Open a terminal and navigate to "sw" folder inside pulpino and execute the following commands

		a) e.g. mkdir build
		
		b) cp cmake_configure.klessydra-s1.gcc.sh build/
		
		c) cd build
		
		d) ./cmake_configure.klessydra-s1.gcc.sh
		   (Execute the above script twice if you ever change the variable that changes the riscv-compiler, since changing the compiler flushes the values of the variables in the cmake cache and gives an error. Executing the script for a second time after changing the riscv-compiler will let the variables be redfined again )
		   
		e) make vcompile

		For running Klessydra tests; the variable "USE_KLESSYDRA_TEST" in the above shell file is set to '1' by default. You only need to build and run your test
		f) (e.g.  make vect_sum_single_funct_call_all_test_perf.vsimc) FOR KLESSYDRA T1x ONLY!!!
		General tests for all versions of Klessydra are also available
		g) (e.g.  make barrier_test.vsimc)
		
		h) You can run one of the PULPino native tests,  (e.g. make testALU.vsimc)
			
	IT"S DONE!!!!!!

Supplimentary Information:

7.	In order to run tests in Modelsim, go to the build folder and do the following:
		make nameofthetest.vsim (or .vsimc to run a test without modelsim GUI)

8. Klessydra-S1 libraries are available, and their function is described in the software runtime manual fuond in the Docs folder

# S1 Extensions illustration

The following illustrates briefly the parameters of the S1, and their usage settings.

- For more details about the Klessydra processing cores, please refer to the technincal manual in Docs
- For more details about the Klessydra runtime libraries, please refer to the software runtime manual in Docs

Extensions of S1 core:

The S1 can be configed in many ways in the from the "cmake_configure.klessydra-s1.gcc.sh" found in the sw forlder:

You will find the following generics that will be passed to the RTL. **_Read the comments next to the variables before modifying_**:
1)  "THREAD_POOL_SIZE" sets the number of hardware threads. This should not be more then 1.
2)	"LUTRAM_RF" this variable creates a LUTRAM based registerfile instead of a flip-flop based one, it is good for FPGA synthesis as LUTRAMs based regfiles are more efficient than FF based ones.
3)	"RV32E" this enables the embedded extension of the RISCV ISA, and makes the regfile to be half its original size (16 regs only).
4)	"RV32M" this enable the M-extension of the RISCV ISA. The mul instruction is a single cycle instructions, and the mulh/hu/hsu instructions need 3 cycles. divisions are slow, and can be up to 32 cycles, however fast single cycle divisions are availabe for special cases (div by 0, numerator < denominator, numerator is 0, and numerator equals the denominator).
5)	"superscalar_exec_en=1"  Enables superscalar execution when set to 1, else the stall of the pipeline will depend on tha latency of the instruction executing. This more than doubles the speed of the core in many applications, however if in the exceptional case the RTL is not simulating correctly, disable this and see whether the RTL will work again.
6)	"accl_en"  Enables the generation of the hardware accelerator of the S1.
7)	"replicate_accl_en" Once set, it replicates the accelerator for every thread, this is 0 in the S1
8)	"multithreaded_accl_en" Set this to 1 to let the replicated accelerator have shared functional units, this should be 0 in the S1
9)	"SPM_NUM" The number of scratchpads available "Minimum allowed is 2". When the acclerator is replicated, each hardware thread will have scratchpads equal to SPM_NUM, so in a THREAD_POOL_SIZE of 3 we will have 3*SPM_NUM scratchpads in totals
10)	Addr_Width" This address is for scratchpads. Setting this will make the size of the spm to be: "2^Addr_Width -1"
11)	"SIMD" Changing the SIMD, would increase the DLP by increasing the number of the functional units in the accelerator, and the number of banks in the spms acordingly (can be power of 2 only e.g. 1,2,4,8) no more than SIMD 8 is allowed. Setting this to '8' with replicate_accl_en and superscalar_exec_en being set to '1' as well will make the accelerator run at peak performance.
12)	"MCYCLE_EN" Can be set to 1 or 0 only. Setting to zero will disable MCYCLE and MCYCLEH
13)	"MINSTRET_EN" Can be set to 1 or 0 only. Setting to zero will disable MINSTRET and MINSTRETH
14)	"MHPMCOUNTER_EN" Can be set to 1 or 0 only. Setting to zero will disable all performance counters except "MCYCLE/H" and "MINSTRET/H"
15)	"count_all" Perfomance counters count for all the harts instead of there own hart
16)	"debug_en" Generates the debug unit, the debug unit is elimentary and might need some further evaluation and testing
17)	"tracer_en" Generates an instruction tracer, used for debugging
